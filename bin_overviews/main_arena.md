## Main Arena

- [back](readme.md)

So here, I just wanted to briefly discuss the main arena. The main arena is a `malloc_state` struct data structure, used to model information in regards to the heap. The main arena is stored in the global variables for libc, and is a `malloc_state` struct:

```
/* There are several instances of this struct ("arenas") in this
   malloc.  If you are adapting this malloc in a way that does NOT use
   a static or mmapped malloc_state, you MUST explicitly zero-fill it
   before using. This malloc relies on the property that malloc_state
   is initialized to all zeroes (as is true of C statics).  */

static struct malloc_state main_arena =
{
  .mutex = _LIBC_LOCK_INITIALIZER,
  .next = &main_arena,
  .attached_threads = 1
};
```
We see the declaration here:

```
struct malloc_state
{
  /* Serialize access.  */
  __libc_lock_define (, mutex);

  /* Flags (formerly in max_fast).  */
  int flags;

  /* Set if the fastbin chunks contain recently inserted free blocks.  */
  /* Note this is a bool but not all targets support atomics on booleans.  */
  int have_fastchunks;

  /* Fastbins */
  mfastbinptr fastbinsY[NFASTBINS];

  /* Base of the topmost chunk -- not otherwise kept in a bin */
  mchunkptr top;

  /* The remainder from the most recent split of a small request */
  mchunkptr last_remainder;

  /* Normal bins packed as described above */
  mchunkptr bins[NBINS * 2 - 2];

  /* Bitmap of bins */
  unsigned int binmap[BINMAPSIZE];

  /* Linked list */
  struct malloc_state *next;

  /* Linked list for free arenas.  Access to this field is serialized
 	by free_list_lock in arena.c.  */
  struct malloc_state *next_free;

  /* Number of threads attached to this arena.  0 if the arena is on
 	the free list.  Access to this field is serialized by
 	free_list_lock in arena.c.  */
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T attached_threads;

  /* Memory allocated from the system in this arena.  */
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T system_mem;
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T max_system_mem;
};
```

And we see an example here, although we've seen other examples in some of the other docs.

}
```

#### Mutex

The mutex is a mutex, used to help prevent race conditions with multithreaded programs.

#### Flags

So this is just a flags value. Right now, the only flag value I see being stored in here, is a value which is supposed to mean if MORECORE (the function malloc uses to get more system memory) will return contiguous memory or not:

```
/*
   NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT indicates that MORECORE does not return contiguous
   regions.  Otherwise, contiguity is exploited in merging together,
   when possible, results from consecutive MORECORE calls.

   The initial value comes from MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS, but is
   changed dynamically if mmap is ever used as an sbrk substitute.
 */

#define NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT 	(2U)

#define contiguous(M)      	(((M)->flags & NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT) == 0)
#define noncontiguous(M)   	(((M)->flags & NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT) != 0)
#define set_noncontiguous(M)   ((M)->flags |= NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT)
#define set_contiguous(M)  	((M)->flags &= ~NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT)
```

#### have_fastchunks

So this is an integer value, but realistically it's treated as a boolean value. If it's `0x01` (true), that means this arena has a fastbin that has chunks ready to be recycled. If it's `0x00` (false) that means there are no chunks in any of the fastbins.

#### fastbinsY

This is an array with `10` entries. Each entry is the head of a unique fastbin. If the fastbin is empty, this is a null ptr (`0x00`). The top few fastbins aren't used.

#### top

So, this is a ptr to the top chunk. The top chunk (also known as the heap wilderness) is a chunk of memory in the heap, that pieces of memory will be split off of to create new chunks. This ptr will be adjusted to account for the decrease in size of the top chunk, when that happens. Also under certain conditions, when chunks that are adjacent to the top chunk are freed, the top chunk can consolidate with adjacent free chunks to expand the top chunk.

#### last_remainder

So, part of the bin functionality is that it can actually split a chunk it has into 2 smaller chunks, with one of the smaller chunks being used for a `malloc` allocation (and a remainder). This exact process will be covered more in depth later. This holds a ptr to a chunk, which is the remainder of the last time this process was done.

#### bins

This is the array, where the unsorted bin, and all of the small / large bins are stored (or rather the "head bin chunk" for the respective bin).

#### binmap

So part of the functionality within malloc (will be discussed later) is it will scan through all of the bins, looking for a particular chunk. This is a data structure used to aid that process. It will effectively maintain an array of bits, where each bit maps to an individual bin. The value of this bit will signify if the bin is empty. Since there are `126` different bins, that means there must be at least `126` different bits.

#### next

So, in programs where multiple arenas are needed, this is a next ptr to another `malloc_state` (arena) in a linked list that connects them. At this time, I'm not too certain about the details with it.

#### next_free

So, in programs where multiple arenas are needed, this is a next ptr to the next freed `malloc_state` in a linked list. At this time, I'm not too certain about the details with it.

#### attached_threads

This is just an int value, that means how many threads will be using this `malloc_state`.

#### system_mem

This is the total amount of memory this main arena has to deal with.

#### max_system_mem

This I believe is a value which represents the max possible memory the system can have. Not too certain with the details regarding this one.
